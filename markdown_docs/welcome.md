# Quick Introduction to the Workshop


## Contacts

    * Dr. Matt Settles <settles@ucdavis.edu>, Director, UC Davis Bioinformatics Core

## Computing needs

The quantity of data storage and the amount of processing needed should be sufficient on most laptop systems; however, many of the application used in the workshop requires the ability to compile code on a command line. As such we expect you to have these tools available on your system in order to fully participate.

### The applications that need to be first installed are:

    1. [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)

## Data Availability

    The data files needed for this workshop can be found [here](https://bioshare.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/bioshare/view/2021-ASM-genome-assembly/) on our Bioshare application. Please download all these data to your computers before continuing on.
