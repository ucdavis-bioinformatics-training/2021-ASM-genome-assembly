# Hands-on Workshop Assembling and Annotating Bacterial Genomes Using PacBio Long Reads

This workshop aims to provide to the participants the basic knowledge from beginning to end to assemble near-complete or complete high-quality bacterial genomes from PacBio long reads.

## The bacterium _Bacillus thuringiensis_ RZ2MS9
Today, you will assemble the genome of a bacterium that was isolated from the Amazon rainforest, in the city of Maués, Amazonas state, Brazil. 
This bacterium was isolated from the rizosphere of guarana plants (_Paullinia cupana_).

The _Bacillus thuringiensis_ RZ2MS9 is a plant growth-promoting bacteria, so it harbors several genes related with plant growth-promoting traits, such as the production of indole acetic acid, solubilization of phosphate, and more.

## Computing needs

The quantity of data storage and the amount of processing needed should be sufficient on most laptop systems; however, many of the application used in the workshop requires the ability to compile code on a command line. As such we expect you to have these tools available on your system in order to fully participate.

### The applications that need to be first installed are:

    1. [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)

## Data Availability

    The data files needed for this workshop can be found [here](https://bioshare.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/bioshare/view/2021-ASM-genome-assembly/) on our Bioshare application. Please download all these data to your computers before continuing on.
