# Hands-on Workshop Assembling and Annotating Bacterial Genomes Using PacBio Long Reads

This workshop aims to provide to the participants the basic knowledge from beginning to end to assemble near-complete or complete high-quality bacterial genomes from PacBio long reads.

## The bacterium _Bacillus thuringiensis_ RZ2MS9
Today, you will assemble the genome of a bacterium that was isolated from the Amazon rainforest, in the city of Maués, Amazonas state, Brazil. 
This bacterium was isolated from the rizosphere of guarana plants (_Paullinia cupana_).

The _Bacillus thuringiensis_ RZ2MS9 is a plant growth-promoting bacteria, so it harbors several genes related with plant growth-promoting traits, such as the production of indole acetic acid, solubilization of phosphate, and more.
